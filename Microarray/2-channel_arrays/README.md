# GeneLab bioinformatics processing pipeline for two-channel microarray data

> **The document [`GL-DPPD-710X.md`](https://developer.nasa.gov/asaravia/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/2-channel_arrays/GL-DPPD-710X.md) holds an overview and example code of how GeneLab processes two-channel Microarray datasets. Previous GL-DPPD-710X revisions are available in the [Previous_GL-DPPD-710X_Revisions](https://developer.nasa.gov/asaravia/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/master/Microarray/2-channel_arrays/Previous_GL-DPPD-710X_Revisions) sub-directory. Exact processing code and GL-DPPD-710X revision used for specific datasets that have been released are available in the [GLDS_Processing_Scripts](https://developer.nasa.gov/asaravia/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/master/Microarray/2-channel_arrays/GLDS_Processing_Scripts) sub-directory and are also provided with their processed data in the [GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS) repository](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects).**
